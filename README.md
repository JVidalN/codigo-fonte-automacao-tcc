# Automation of didactic experiment in physics: Transformation of gravitational potential energy in kinetic energy


My project for completing the undergraduate course in information systems, where, it was built from an experimental apparatus, motivated to contribute by automating the process of obtaining data from open hardware and software, aiming at low cost, to playfully study the problem the conversion of potential gravitational energy into kinetic using a hotwheels track.

> Technologies used: `Arduino`, `Raspberry Pi`, `infrared sensors` and `C/C++`
