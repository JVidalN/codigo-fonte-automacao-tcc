Arduino source code to obtain infrared sensor times. This code was used in the apparatus created for my project to conclude the undergraduate course in Information Systems at the University of the State of Bahia.

Title:
# Automation of didactic experiment in physics: Transformation of gravitational potential energy in kinetic energy

Description:

My project for completing the undergraduate course in information systems, where, it was built from an experimental apparatus, motivated to contribute by automating the process of obtaining data from open hardware and software, aiming at low cost, to playfully study the problem the conversion of potential gravitational energy into kinetic using a hotwheels track.

Technologies used: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, infrared sensors and C/C++
